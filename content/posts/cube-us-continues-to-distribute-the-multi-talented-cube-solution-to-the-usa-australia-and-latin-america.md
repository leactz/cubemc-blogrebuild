**_Press Release Update October 2013_**: CUBEUS has been in place for well over a year now and has been highly successful. Local shipping in the US has substantially grown CUBE sales in the US market. CUBEUS has also been instrumental in expanding the CUBEs presence into another 31 other countries, and over 200 cities worldwide.

Original Press Release from 2012-09-21 follows:

## CUBE US continues to distribute the multi-talented CUBE solution to the USA, Australia and Latin America. CUBE US provides Audio Marketing Professionals with fast and economical delivery, including the option of drop shipping.

_Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and Charlottesville, VA, USA_ The CUBE created a stir when Exponential Solutions exhibited it at the recent OHMA/IBMA conference in Scottsdale, Arizona -- and now CUBE US makes the CUBE even more accessible and economical to Audio Marketing Providers in the USA, Australia, Latin America and elsewhere.

CUBE US, based near Charlottesville VA, assembles and ships CUBEs from the United States on behalf of Exponential Solutions. When Audio Marketing Providers order the CUBE, they can be guaranteed the fastest and most economical delivery in the USA, as well as to those international regions that can most economically be served from the USA. As an additional convenience for Providers, CUBE US can also drop ship directly to US end-customers. This further reduces the Provider's shipping costs, and the need to carry temporary inventory to meet customer demand. For international orders, CUBE US offers a configurable international power supply option. Pricing and ordering remain identical.

Unlike many MOH devices on the market, CUBE is available exclusively to Providers: "We won't compete against our valuable customers", says Steve Hashman of Exponential Solutions. Many Audio Marketing Providers are currently evaluating what's new in On-Hold and In-Store technology, and are worried they may not be asking the right questions. "If you keep doing the same things you've always done, how can you expect to take your business to the next level?", says Chester Hull, owner of Prosound, a leading US Provider: "Our customers expect more and we must innovate, while increasing ROI. CUBE is a flexible tool that delivers on all these fronts." According to Charl Coetzee of Exponential Solutions, there are three questions that Audio Marketing Providers should ask about equipment. "We've put together a guide that distills the three most critical questions to ask" says Charl, "and we're making it available freely to everyone, whether you're a CUBE user or not."

CUBE users include some of the largest and most experienced Providers who deliver On-Hold and In-Store Messaging services to various industries: "CUBE allows us to move up the value chain, and increase our business volume and profitability. CUBE is our preferred platform for multiple audio service opportunities," says Nick Findlay, Managing Director of Premier Business Audio UK. "With CUBE, Providers can literally manage their MOH and In-Store business while sipping cocktails on the beach", says Chester Hull: "We're thrilled CUBE US will make CUBE even more accessible in the USA and world-wide, and help Providers increase the return on audio equipment investment." CUBE installations span numerous industries and brands across the USA and 10 other countries.

Exponential Solutions is a member of OHMA, the On Hold Messaging Association, and a sponsor of the Audio Marketing Association (Europe)'s Annual Conference.
