## Interactive music provider Virtual Jukebox Ltd (London, UK) has selected The CUBE from Exponential Solutions Inc (Calgary, Canada) to deliver its music service to venues worldwide.

London, UK and Calgary, Alberta, Canada (PRWEB) January 10, 2014 Virtual Jukebox announced it chose the CUBE by Exponential Solutions, worldwide, to support its popular Virtual Jukebox solution. Virtual Jukebox provides venues such as bars, restaurants and leisure attractions with both Background and Interactive Music solutions. The CUBE is the world-leading integrated audio and visual content delivery platform for the In-Store and On Hold markets.

 Backed by one of the world’s largest music libraries, Virtual Jukebox provides venues with unlimited access to fully licensed commercial music. It also provides the tools to manage playlists and schedules with ease. Not only is Virtual Jukebox an industry leading Background Music service, its innovative interactive offering allows venues to engage with customers like never before. A smartphone interface allows customers of venues to browse, search, pay for and play music within the venue they’re in. Interactive Music can be used to increase venue visitations and dwell time, which directly impacts market growth and revenues.

 Virtual Jukebox seamlessly opts-in customers in a venue to capture their data, and provides easy-to-use tools enabling venues to advertise and promote products and events back to subscribers by SMS (text message). With the integration to Facebook and Twitter, Virtual Jukebox can also be used to drive Social Media exposure of venues - this can create a viral effect. Virtual Jukebox has seen great success in the UK, with a client list that includes the University of Bath, Mint Group, Bowlplex, Ramada Hotels, Punch Taverns, Greene King and Spirit. In 2013, distribution was expanded to USA, Canada and Australia with new territories planned for 2014. Virtual Jukebox has selected The CUBE hardware, from Exponential Solutions to deliver the Virtual Jukebox service to venues worldwide.

 Virtual Jukebox runs a bespoke app on The CUBE to communicate to the Virtual Jukebox platform and fetch media content. Adam Castleton, COO of Virtual Jukebox said: “The limitless possibilities of the CUBE platform, combined with the exceptional support provided by Exponential Solutions, ensure that the Virtual Jukebox solutions will continue to be the industry solution of choice.” A connectivity fail-safe ensures continuous playback should the venue’s Internet connection fail. The lightweight hardware with its solid state storage, remote access and diagnostics systems, and flexibility allow Virtual Jukebox to support thousands of locations from its London HQ.
